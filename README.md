# 📰 AI-Powered Fake News Detection System

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to identify and classify fake news articles using machine learning techniques. Leveraging **TF-IDF** for feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification, the system distinguishes between real and fake news based on textual content.

> Developed during my Microsoft AI internship using GitHub Copilot.
